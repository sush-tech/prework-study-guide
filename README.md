# Prework Study Guide Webpage
Use the following questions as a guide:
What was your motivation?
Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
What problem does it solve?
What did you learn?
What makes your project stand out?
Your README might also describe some of the challenges you faced, as well as the features you plan to implement in the future. And if your project is deployed, make sure to include a link to the deployed application so people can see it in action!
